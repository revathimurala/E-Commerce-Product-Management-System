# E-Commerce-Product-Management-System
java ecommerce system with JDBC,OOP,Logging

Project overview:

This project implements an E-Commerce Product Management System built with Java, where product data is stored in a relational database accessed through JDBC. It applies object-oriented programming principles to model entities such as products and operations like create, read, update, and delete, providing a simple backend-style management tool.

Features:

1.Product CRUD operations: add new products, update existing ones, fetch product lists, and delete products from the database.

2.Database integration via JDBC for persistent storage and retrieval of product information.

3.Logging support to track system actions and errors, improving debuggability and transparency of operations.

Tech stack:

1.Java as the primary programming language with an object-oriented design.​

2.JDBC for connecting to and interacting with the underlying SQL database.​

3.Logging framework (such as java.util.logging or Log4j) to record application events and issues.

Goals:

The main goal is to build a small but realistic backend for product management while strengthening Java OOP skills. It also aims to give hands-on experience with JDBC, SQL operations, and logging in a structured e-commerce scenario
